A pulsing light and fan remote control over bluetooth on a msp430

A university project for an art student to get a large sack to slowly breathe and pulse with light. Uses a bluetooth terminal application on a phone to remotely control the light and fan breathing cycle speed. Created using msp430g2553 microcontroller with barely any prior embedded systems experience.
